Unity + C# Networking


GameServer is run like a Unity project.
Ongoing project, will probably update it when i find some time.

Future Goals:
Make more Tasks for Crew Mates and scatter them around map, as well as update the % for everyone.
Make animations when players die.
Client side prediction, even with Lerp, movement is laggy so it would be better for Client to move on his machine first and then notify the server.
